<h3>Ingredients</h3>

<ul>
    <li>4 large russet potatoes, peeled and cut into even matchsticks</li>
    <li>4 cups vegetable oil, for frying
    </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons salt
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder
    </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon paprika
    </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon black pepper
    </li>
    <li>1/2 teaspoon onion powder
    </li>
    <li>1/4 teaspoon cayenne pepper (adjust to taste)
    </li>
    <li>Fresh parsley, chopped (for garnish)
    </li>
    <li>Ketchup or your favorite dipping sauces
    </li>
</ul>


<h3>Instructions</h3>

<ol>
    <li>Start by peeling the potatoes and cutting them into uniform matchstick-shaped pieces. Rinse them under cold water to remove excess starch.

    </li>
    <li>Heat the vegetable oil in a large, deep pot to 325째F (163째C). A deep fryer can also be used for this step.

    </li>
    <li>In batches, carefully add the potato matchsticks to the hot oil. Fry them for about 3-4 minutes or until they are just beginning to turn golden. Use a slotted spoon to remove them from the oil and place them on paper towels to drain.

    </li>
    <li>Raise the oil temperature to 375째F (190째C).

    </li>
    <li>In a bowl, mix the salt, garlic powder, paprika, black pepper, onion powder, and cayenne pepper. Toss the partially cooked fries in the seasoning mixture to coat them evenly.

    </li>
    <li>Once the oil is at the right temperature, return the seasoned fries to the oil in batches. Fry them for an additional 3-4 minutes or until they are crispy and golden brown.

    </li>
    <li>Remove the fries from the oil and drain them on fresh paper towels. Season them with a pinch of salt while they are still hot.

    </li>
    <li>Transfer the crispy homemade French fries to a serving dish, garnish with chopped fresh parsley, and serve them with your favorite dipping sauces, such as ketchup, mayonnaise, or aioli.

    </li>
</ol>

<p>These homemade French fries are the epitome of comfort food. With their perfect crispiness and a delightful blend of seasonings, they're ideal for sharing with friends and family, or simply enjoying on your own as a delectable snack.</p>
